What comes next? Beyond integration of visual and computational interactive data analysis 

Interactive visual analysis integrated with computational analyses has gained popularity in genomics. We have previously built interactive analysis systems that are efficient and effective for exploratory analyses of large datasets arranged over richly structured features. For example, in metagenomics data, our Metaviz system provides effective and efficient exploration of hierarchically organized features (taxa), with integration with statistical analysis provided by Bioconductor infrastructure. In this talk, we discuss the next generation of tools where tighter integration between visualization and computation is used to guide and steer the data analysts exploration based on the results of computations of interest performed in the background. We illustrate this design on integrative analyses of epigenetic and transcriptomic data.
